<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which this project was developed on - the Jagera, Turrbul and Giabal nations, and pay our respects to elders past, present and emerging.

Since the colonisation of lands belonging to our First Nations people in 1788, Australia is a country that has been marked by migration. Being girt by sea has meant for centuries Australians have arrived by boats.

While we are recognised as a multicultural country - one question remains - where are we all really from? Our migration policies have shaped us as a nation with the White Australia Policy restricting access for many years. But how have these policies changed over time and who calls Australia home now and into the future?

To look into these questions we’ve done a deep-dive into historical data to try and find some answers - using this as a basis to predict our migration into the future.

This analysis is important not only to the Government in understanding patterns in migration and the effect of policies over time, but also to citizens keen to gain an understanding of what has shaped us as a nation. As an educational tool - it is also useful for students researching migration to Australia.

As an educational tool - it is also useful for students and teachers researching migration to Australia.

Historical data sets including the Register of immigrants 1864 to 1878; Australia and Refugees, 1901 2002: An Annotated Chronology Based on Official Source; and The Development of Australian immigration policy – memorandum with timeline; were used alongside the Australian Bureau of Statistics Data API and Australian Migration Statistics data set.
